          “The Church, is not fully organized, in its proper order, and cannot
          be, until the Temple is completed, where places will be provided for
          the administration of the ordinances of the Priesthood.” <br />-Joseph
          Smith Jr.

        <p>
          The Book of Mormon can be a powerful tool for unlocking the symbolism
          and principles found in the Holy Temple, with its persistent themes of
          redemption, mercy, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The purpose of
          both the Book of Mormon and the temple ordinances are to draw us
          closer to the Savior, and they accomplish this best when paired
          together.

          “Without doubt, the temple is the great symbol of the Lord’s kingdom
          and our membership in it. But is also seems to me that the temple is
          the great symbol of the foreordained plan of salvation” (Andrew C.
          Skinner). Symbols, especially those found in the temple, are powerful
          reminders of God’s omniscience and love for us. Symbols allow Him to
          teach us line by line until we are able come to a perfect knowledge.
