        <h2>Symbolism and the Temple</h2>
        <p>
          “The house of the Lord, bathed in light, standing out in the darkness,
          becomes symbolic of the power and the inspiration of the gospel of
          Jesus Christ standing as a beacon in a world that sinks ever further
          into spiritual darkness” <br />
          -President Boyd K. Packer

        <h2>Why Symbolism?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>
          The Lord loves symbolism. The idea of using one thing to remind or
          teach us of a deeper truth has been used by the Lord since Adam and
          Eve. When they sacrificed the firstlings of their flocks, they were
          taught that it was a symbol of the Atonement of Christ. Symbolism
          allows the Lord to teach us very personally. Because symbols can have
          many different meanings, the Lord can reveal what is relevant to us at
          the moment we need it. Ultimately, each symbol is the temple points us
          to Christ. Elder David E. Sorensen taught that temples “symbolically
          and literally remind us and teach us about Christ and His Father. …
          Our temple worship today includes many symbolic references to Christ,
          from the spires on the outside that point our minds heavenward, to the
          white clothing we wear inside the temple.”

        <h2>Temples as "Templates"</h2>

          It is interesting that the English words “temple” and “template” both
          come from the same latin root, “templum.” With this in mind, we can
          look at the temple as a “template” for the Plan of Salvation. Author
          David J. Ridges wrote, “The presentation of the endowment in the
          temple culminates in the symbolic bestowal of eternal life in the
          celestial kingdom upon the worthy participants. The temple endowment,
          then, is among other things a presentation, a representation, and a
          symbol.” Each ordinance in the temple is symbolic of our eternal
          progression into the presence of God.

          I believe that the Lord almost never does anything for a singular
          reason. He always has the entire eternal picture in mind, and thus can
          fulfill many purposes with one action. Such is the case with the
          physical structure of temples. Not only are temples beautiful
          structures, but they are object lessons as well. The beauty reminds us
          of the kingdom of heaven. The spires remind us to look up to God. The
          angel that adorns many temples reminds us that the gospel has been
          restored in the last days, and they when we exit the temple we are
          prepared to join in proclaiming the good news. The physical placement
          of various rooms remind us of our progression in this life as we move
          towards our Heavenly Father. The twelve oxen in the baptismal font
          represent the twelve tribes of Israel, and that when we enter into the
          baptismal covenant we become members of the house of Israel.
