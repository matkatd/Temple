        <h2>The Book of Mormon and Temples</h2>
        <p>
          While temple ordinances are not explicitly mentioned in the Book of
          Mormon, we do know that the Nephites and Lamanites built temples and
          worshipped in them. Below you will find examples of temple doctrine
          taught in the Book of Mormon

        <h2>2 Nephi 2</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>
          In 2 Nephi 2, Lehi uses the story of the Creation and of Adam and Eve
          to teach Jacob about agency, opposition, the nature of God, and our
          redemption through Jesus Christ. These principles are strikingly
          similar to those taught in the House of the Lord today, and emphasize
          this teaching of Joseph Smith: “What was the object of gathering the
          Jews, or the people of God in any age of the world? … “The main object
          was to build unto the Lord a house whereby He could reveal unto His
          people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and
          teach the people the way of salvation; for there are certain
          ordinances and principles that, when they are taught and practiced,
          must be done in a place or house built for that purpose”

        <h2>Alma 42</h2>

          Elder John A, Widtsoe taught that, “The temple is a place where
          ceremonies pertaining to Godliness are presented. The great mysteries
          of life, with man’s unanswered questions, are here made clear: (1)
          Where did I come from? (2) Why am I here? (3) Where do I go when life
          is over? Here the needs of the spirit from which all other things of
          life issue are held of paramount importance.” In Alma 39-42, Alma
          taught his son Corianton those same principles to help Corianton
          understand the need for repentance. Interestingly, Alma used the same
          story of the fall of Adam and Eve to teach why a Redeemer was
          necessary and how we can be saved. From this we learn that one purpose
          of the temple is to teach us why we need to repent, and how we can
          obtain forgiveness.

        <h2>3 Nephi</h2>

          When Christ visited the Nephites, He first came to His house in the
          city of Bountiful. While He was there, He taught a sermon similar to
          the sermon on the mount, which included the Beatitudes. Elder Robert
          E. Wells shared this about being “pure in heart”: “In Spanish, the
          term “pure in heart” is translated “clean of heart” (limpios). That is
          closer to the original Greek text. It means no stains, no dirt, no
          marks. It is a physical interpretation, as if talking of clean
          clothing just laundered. It could also refer to clean water, with no
          contamination. It is used with regard to ceremonial cleanliness after
          baptism or after leaving the temple.”

          In addition, Dr. Sidney B, Sperry shared, “Before the resurrection of
          our Lord, ordinance work for the dead could not be carried out either
          in the temples in Palestine or on this continent. But after his
          resurrection, he fully explained such work to the Nephites. This is
          shown by the fact that he quoted in full chapters 3 and 4 of Malachi
          and “expounded them unto the multitude.” (3 Ne. 24:1; 3 Ne. 26:1.)
          Thus, the sealing powers of Elijah as applied to ordinance work for
          the dead became known to the Nephites. We may presume that such work
          was carried out in their temples during the period of their
          righteousness, for four generations.”
